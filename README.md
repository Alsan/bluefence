# bluefence
A DIY BlueProximity alternative.

I was about to install BlueProximity on my Freya desktop and end up with bunch of trouble, so I decided to build my own version of BlueProximity.

This program will scan for particular bluetooth device by its MAC address and will perform a specific task when the device is out of range, or when it's back in range.

This is the first working prototype, DO NOT expect much.
